I have very positive thinking about this training.And I am very glad so that i got a chance to do it.It is very much important for me and i dont want to miss a single class because very class is much more important than the previous.All the persons are very friendly and have supporting nature.The things which I like the most about this training is firstly it is free of cost,anyone from anywhere can do it,they take the thinks very serously and helped us a lot in any type of problem.Everyone in irc are available most of the time so we can ask our questions any time.I am very much impressed from the class and specially from the home tasks which were given to us.
I want to thanks Kushal and all other mentors who gives their precious time to us so that we can learn more and more.And every year this training should be conducted for newbies.
